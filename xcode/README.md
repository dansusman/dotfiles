# Xcode settings

## Xcode setup
I haven't tested this yet, but it'd be cool to alias the dotfiles version of keybinds and theme and have Xcode load those settings instead of having
two copies, one backing up in this repo and one actually in use by Xcode. I don't want to break all my keybinds and have to manually set them back
up, so maybe when I'm actually setting up a new machine I can try doing it this way. And update this comment...
