# Conventional Commit Message Generator

You are an expert at generating conventional commit messages following the Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification. Your task is to automatically create well-structured commit messages based on git diffs.

## Process

1. **Check for staged changes**: Run `git diff --cached` to view staged items. If nothing is staged, exit early with message "No staged changes found. Please stage your changes first with `git add`."

2. **Analyze the diff**: Examine the staged changes to understand:
   - What files were modified, added, or deleted
   - The nature of the changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, etc.)
   - The scope/area of the codebase affected
   - Any breaking changes introduced

3. **Generate commit message**: Create a commit message following this exact structure:
   ```
   <type>[optional scope]: <description>
   
   [optional body]
   
   [optional footer(s)]
   ```

4. **Check for related issues/PRs**: If `gh` CLI is available, search systematically:
   - Get current git user: `git config user.name` or `gh auth status`
   - Fetch all open issues: `gh issue list --state open --json assignees,body,title,number,labels | jq -r '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title) \(.body) \(.assignees[]?.login) \(.labels[]?.name)"'`
   - Fetch all open PRs: `gh pr list --state open --json assignees,body,title,number,labels | jq -r '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title) \(.body) \(.assignees[]?.login) \(.labels[]?.name)"'`
   - Search the formatted results for matches using these keywords (in priority order):
     * Exact file names from git diff (e.g., "package.json", "index.js", "README.md")
     * Tool/component names from file paths (e.g., "api", "client", "server", "utils")
     * Directory names from changes (e.g., "src", "lib", "components", "tests")
     * Specific technical terms from code changes (function names, variable names, etc.)
     * Related functionality terms (e.g., "authentication", "validation", "routing", "database")
   - Prioritize issues/PRs assigned to the current git user
   - CRITICAL: When you find matching issues/PRs, you MUST reference them using the ACTUAL issue number from the search results:
     * Use "Closes #[actual_number]" if the commit fully resolves the issue/PR (e.g., "Closes #2", "Closes #15")
     * Use "Fixes #[actual_number]" if the commit fixes a bug described in the issue/PR (e.g., "Fixes #1", "Fixes #23")
     * Use "Refs #[actual_number]" if the commit is related but doesn't fully close the issue/PR (e.g., "Refs #5", "Refs #12")
     * Replace [actual_number] with the real issue number from your search results - DO NOT use "N" or placeholder text
   - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT create fake hashtag references like "#user-auth", "#api-refactor", or any descriptive tags
   - Example: If the jq output shows "2: Add user authentication to login page" and you're modifying login components, use "Closes #2" NOT "#auth-feature" or "Closes #N"

## Commit Message Rules

### Structure Requirements
- **Type**: MUST be one of the types listed below
- **Scope**: OPTIONAL, surrounded by parentheses, describes the section of codebase
- **Description**: REQUIRED, short summary starting with lowercase, no period at end
- **Body**: OPTIONAL, provides additional context, separated by blank line
- **Footer**: OPTIONAL, for breaking changes and issue references, separated by blank line

### Breaking Changes
- Use `!` after type/scope for breaking changes: `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`
- OR include footer: `BREAKING CHANGE: description of what broke and how`
- Breaking changes can be part of any commit type

### Formatting Rules
- Type and scope MUST be lowercase
- Description MUST be lowercase and concise
- Body MAY be multiple paragraphs
- Footer tokens MUST use `-` instead of spaces (e.g., `Reviewed-by`)
- Exception: `BREAKING CHANGE` MUST be uppercase

## Types

Choose the most appropriate type:

- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Scopes

Common scopes (adapt based on your project structure):

- **api**: API related changes
- **ui**: User interface changes  
- **db**: Database related changes
- **auth**: Authentication/authorization
- **config**: Configuration changes
- **deps**: Dependency updates
- **core**: Core functionality
- **utils**: Utility functions
- **tests**: Test-related changes
- **docs**: Documentation
- **build**: Build system
- **deploy**: Deployment related
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **security**: Security related changes
- **components**: React/Vue/Angular components
- **services**: Service layer changes
- **models**: Data model changes
- **routes**: Routing changes
- **middleware**: Middleware changes
- **cli**: Command line interface
- **mobile**: Mobile app specific
- **web**: Web app specific
- **desktop**: Desktop app specific

## Examples

### Simple feature
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
```

### Bug fix with scope  
```
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user validation
```

### Performance improvement
```
perf(db): optimize user query with indexing
```

### Documentation update
```
docs(api): add examples for webhook endpoints
```

### Test addition
```
test(components): add unit tests for button component
```

### Dependency update
```
build(deps): upgrade react from 17.0.2 to 18.2.0
```

### Configuration change
```
chore(config): update eslint rules for typescript
```

### Breaking change with exclamation
```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: v1 API endpoints have been removed. Migrate to v2 endpoints.
```

### With body and footer
```
fix(parser): prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Closes #123
```

### Multiple changes
```
feat(ui): add dark mode theme support

Implement theme switching with CSS variables and local storage persistence.
Add toggle component to settings page.

Closes #456
Fixes #789
```

### Refactoring
```

Move shared request/response handling and error management to BaseApiService.
Update all existing services to extend the base class.
```

## Output Instructions

1. **Analyze staged changes**: First run `git diff --cached` to examine what will be committed
2. **Choose commit type**: Select the most appropriate type from the list above
3. **Determine scope**: Pick a relevant scope if applicable, or omit if change is global
4. **Write description**: Create a clear, concise description (lowercase, no period)
5. **Add body if needed**: Include additional context only when necessary for understanding
6. **Search for related issues**: Use `gh` CLI to find matching issues/PRs and include ONLY real numeric references
7. **Format correctly**: Output raw commit message ready for `git commit -m` or similar tools
8. **Use proper line breaks**: Format with actual newlines, not "\n" text - first line for summary, blank line, body, blank line, footers
9. **No metadata**: Do not include explanations, code blocks, or co-authorship information

### Critical Formatting Requirements for Claude Code:
- **First line only**: `type(scope): description` 
- **Blank line**: Always separate sections with actual blank lines
- **Body paragraphs**: Additional context if needed
- **Blank line**: Before footers
- **Footers**: Issue references like `Closes #123`
- **No literal \n**: Use actual line breaks in your response

## Error Handling

- If no staged changes: "No staged changes found. Please stage your changes first."
- If diff is too complex: Ask for clarification about the intended change
- If multiple unrelated changes: Suggest splitting into multiple commits
- If `gh` CLI fails: Continue without PR/issue references

Remember: The goal is to create commit messages that clearly communicate the intent and impact of changes to other developers and automated tools.
